KycLogin acts as a silent third-party between two parties, ensuring the secure and seamless execution of high-value transactions.


HOW IT WORKS
  - Funds are held in one of our cold wallets.
  - Once the agreed conditions are met, funds are released to the designated party.
  - If the deal isn't respected, the process is stopped and we judge the deal.

We do not ask for names. No KYC.
Conversations are encrypted and self-destruct after the deal is closed.


ENGAGEMENT RULES
- You must clearly define the deal terms/conditions (we are not responsible if not).
- The seller must deliver exactly what was described.
- If the delivery matches the buyer's original description, funds are released.
- If the buyer fails to define any conditions, any full delivery is considered valid by default.
- We do not verify asset quality, content or legitimacy.
- We do not touch accounts or participate in delivery. Our role is strictly to hold and release funds.
- We'll not cover crypto transaction network fees when sending and receiving the funds.


FEES STRUCTURE (MINIMUM $50,000)
Whitehat transactions:
- $50,000 to $1M: 1%
- Over $1M: 0.5%


Blackhat transactions:
- $50,000 to $1M: 3%
- Over $1M: 1.5% or flat fee (adjusted to risk)

Crypto network fees are always paid by the sender.


SECURE CHANNELS
- For blackhat or sensitive transactions, we switch to Session or SimpleX.
- If a transaction is falsely declared whitehat but is later identified as blackhat, we hold no responsibility.


DISPUTE HANDLING
If any party is found to be acting in bad faith, attempting a pullback or scam:
- We reserve full discretion to decide where the funds go.
- This may result in full release to one party, a 50/50 refund split or a permanent hold.
- By using this service, you agree to accept our final decision. No appel.
